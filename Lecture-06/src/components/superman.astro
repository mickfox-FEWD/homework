          <p class="superhero-card" style="break-inside: avoid">
            Superman has super strength, speed, flight, invulnerability as well
            as his renowned X-ray and heat vision. The most powerful being on
            the planet, his amazing abilities are also a melancholy reminder of
            how different he is from the people heâ€™s dedicated to protect.
