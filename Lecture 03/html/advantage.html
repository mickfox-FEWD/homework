  <!-- Create a web page that includes an unordered list describing 
   at least three advantages of using CSS. The text “CSS Advantages” 
   should be contained within <h1> tags. This page should include a 
    hyperlink to the W3C website. Write the HTML code so that one of 
    the advantages is configured to be a class called news. 
    Place an e-mail link to yourself on the web page. 
    The web page should be associated with the external style sheet 
    called ex8.css. Save the page as advantage.html

    *** 8 E
    Modify the advantage.html file to use an inline style. The inline 
    style should be applied to the <h1> tag and configure it to have red text. 
    Save the advantage.html page, and test in a browser. Notice how 
    the <h1> text color specified in the style sheet is overridden by the 
    inline style.
