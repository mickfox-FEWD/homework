      the following example is taken directly from the course slides (unit 2,
      slide 11)

    <blockquote style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace">
      &lt;h1 style="font-size: 250%; color: red;&gt; Town Hall&lt;/h1&gt;

        It was giving errors that took lot of trouble to detect. Turned out the
        actual example in the notes seems to be incorrect in that it doesn't
        close the inverted comma. Pretty poor TBH.
